Nick Bostrom's argument is essentially that if the following are not true about the base reality:

    1. Reality went extinct before developing simulations.
    2. Reality lost interest before developing simulations

then we are likely in a simulation. This program provides a simple visualizer of this argument by using a tree structure with the root as the base reality, and the descendants as the simulated realities. The user selects the number of simulations that the base reality decides to create, which is the number of child nodes/simulations the root node/base reality has, and, by nature, the number of child nodes/simulations each of those child nodes/simulations have. This will show us that amongst one base reality, there are infinitely many simulated realities in this situation (program stops creating new nodes to avoid infinite runtime). Therefore, the probability that we are in a simulation would be 1 in infinity.
